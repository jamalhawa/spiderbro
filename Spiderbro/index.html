    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Spiderbro is a teenage/young adult male with superpowers that resemble a
      spider. Everything known about him is simply speculation, as nobody truly
      knows his identity. Although, He has been spotted with a woman with red
      hair from time to time. Other than that however, she is the only lead we
      have pertaining to his identity.
    </p>

    <h3>Powers</h3>
    <p>
      As stated before, his powers resemble a spider. These include, but are not
      limited to extreme athleticism, immense strength relative to bodyweight, a
      “spidey-sense”, sticky fingers and feet, and web slinging. Speculators
      link this to a “radioactive spider bite”, but that makes little sense. To
      be fair though, not much about him “makes sense”. He has a separate power,
      perhaps linked or unlinked to his other ones. Spiderbro has a remarkable
      metabolism. In other words, he can eat ANYTHING. Despite the fact his diet
      consists only of fast food, he doesn’t seem to gain weight. He also
      metabolizes alcohol like its water. He is known to drink multiple cases of
      it before tapping out.

    <h5>Spiderbro Often Perches on the Tops of buildings</h5>

    <h3>Physicals</h3>
    <p>
      He is about 5'8”-5'10”, but if anyone were to ask him, he would insist
      that he is above six feet. And strangely, whenever an attractive female
      reporter asks him his height, the number moves up to 6’3”. He looks to be
      in great shape–perhaps swinging off buildings all day is great exercise.
      Overall he has a good upper body. His legs could definitely use work
      though. At the various campus gyms he is spotted at, he never hits his
      legs, rather opting for chest and bicep work.

    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>
      Spiderbro’s hobbies include partying, playing American Football, jumping
      off of buildings, jumping onto buildings, and trying to pick up women
      (keyword is trying). When he isn’t fighting forces of evil, Spiderbro is
      frequently caught at parties getting “crunked”. As previously mentioned,
      he also enjoys going to the gym from time to time. He can’t actually
      benefit from our “normal human” weights and machines due to his super
      strength, so it is presumed he simply goes to show off his incredible
      feats of power, such as his 10 plate bench press. He doesn’t shake your
      hand or look you in the eye, rather, his preferred form of greeting is a
      fist bump and/or a “whats good bruh”. He also never cleans up after his
      webs, always makes sure to keep his elbows ON the table, and at the end of
      the day, after beating up some bad guys, he always puffs on his mango
      vape. You know, if he didn’t save our city here and there, he would kind
      of be a douche…

    <h3>Enemies</h3>
    <p>
      Although Spiderbro usually focuses on smaller crimes, he has been taken to
      his limits by a few foes. Most notably his polar opposite, Venom. Venom
      abides traffic laws, is quite tidy and organized, and NEVER forgets to say
      please or thank you. Aside from the villainy and malice he participates
      in, Venom actually seems like a well rounded guy. Alas, Spiderman has
      bested him in their conflicts, keeping our city safe.

    <h5>Spiderbro Confronts Venom...</h5>

    <h3>The Red Haired Woman</h3>
    <p>
      Despite his elusive nature, he seems to fixate on one civilian. A lovely
      young woman with red hair. In various Spiderbro fanclubs, they refer to
      her as “Mary Jane”, due to her vivid green eyes resembling the color of
      mary jane–the drug. Poetic. He seems to regularly swing with her and
      prioritizes her in zones of conflict. Due to this, there have been
      questions brought up about a romantic relationship. Efforts are being made
      everyday in order to find this woman’s identity, as she is the key to
      unveiling the mask of the Spiderbro.
    </p>

    <h3>Relation with Football</h3>
    <p>
      Another lead to Spiderbro’s identity could be football for a couple
      reasons. He is often spotted playing at local campuses and parks. Also,
      Spiderbro came into existence only after prominent highschool football
      coach, Mark Ben (referred to by some of his players as “Uncle” or “Uncle
      Ben”), was murdered while getting robbed for his wallet. He was like
      family to his players, and was known and loved around his community.
      Currently, the entire former football roster is being put under immense
      questioning by fellow Spiderbro enthusiasts. I personally think it's
      far-fetched, but it's cool to think the tragic death of a coach sparked
      the comeuppance of our beloved hero.
